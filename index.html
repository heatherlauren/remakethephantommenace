  <h1>Welcome to the rebellion</h1>
  <h2>www.remakethephantommenace.com</h2>
  <p>This is a campaign to provide Disney an opportunity to course correct with the Star Wars franchise. The fans are completely divided and the core goal of Star Wars has been abandoned. The goal is to not make one half of the fandom happy over the other, it is to make a film that the fandom in general as a whole enjoys.</p>
  
  <p>The hero archetypes of the original films is what made these so great, it made characters that everyone could relate to regardless of their background and beliefs. No longer having this core element along with poor storytelling, has made the franchise divisive and in disarray.</p>
  
  <p>The <b>absolutely, totally real</b> producers behind this have pledged to cover the budget, but you can pledge an amount to have your voice heard. </p>
